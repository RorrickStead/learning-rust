# Overview
A quick search for the Rust language will direct you to the language's official
website https://www.rust-lang.org. From there, multiple paths are provided
to putting Rust in your hands. 

# Development Environments

## Local Computer
To install Rust on your computer, follow directions provided at 
https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install.

## Container
Utilize your favorite container registry and runtime as a dev environment.
Pull down a container with Rust installed from the [official Docker Hub page]
(https://hub.docker.com/_/rust). Debian, Alpine, Bookwork, Bullseye versions
available with multiple architectures supported.

Alternatively, checkout the Rust container [Github repo]
(https://github.com/rust-lang/docker-rust). Fork or clone the repo and 
craft a container to meet your specific needs. 

## Rust Playground
On a different computer, need a quick code check, or want to trial run Rust
before installing? Checkout the [Rust Playground]
(https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2021)
to write, lint, test, build, and run Rust code. Also checkout the Playground's
[Github repo](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-playground) to understand
how it runs under the hood.
